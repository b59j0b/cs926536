Consider   the   following   3D   equations   defined   on   Ω   =   (—1, 1)   ×   (—1, 1)   ×   (—1, 1):

The   boundary   conditions   are
F1   (—1,y,   z) = Fb   (y,   z),          F3   (x,—1,   z) =   Fb   (x,z),             F5   (x,y,—1) = Fb   (x,y),
F2   (1,y,   z) = F4   (x,1,   z) =   F6   (x,y, 1) =   0,
where
   
•    Solve   this   system   of equations   numerically   for   σ   = 0.1, 1, 10, 100.
•    Let   m   =   F1    + F2    + F3      + F4      +   F5      +   F6   .       Assume   σ    =    1/ϵ   .       Derive   the   equation   of   m   that   appro代 写modeling and numerical simulationsMatlab
